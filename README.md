ArtVision: A Collaborative E-Commerce Art Gallery Platform. Our team is developing an interactive and user-friendly art gallery website where art enthusiasts can share, discover, and purchase artwork. The platform leverages modern technologies for both front-end (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React) and back-end development (Python/Django, PostgreSQL).
